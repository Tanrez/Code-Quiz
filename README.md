# Code-Quiz
A combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive challenges. A timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

 I wasn't able to figure out how to add a scoreboard. I feel as close as I could be to understanding localstorage API's.
 I kept having problems with the timer so instead of it timing you throughout the quiz it gives you only 5s to answer each question. It'll be counted wrong if it surpasses 5s.
